      <description>Powercore V2.0 User Manual What is the Powercore V2.0? The Powercore V2.0 is an open-source wire EDM (electrical discharge machining) power supply developed by Rack Robotics. It aims to provide a cost-effective and easily replicable solution for wire EDM enthusiasts and professionals.&#xA;What is wire EDM? Wire Electrical Discharge Machining (Wire EDM) is a manufacturing process used to cut intricate shapes and contours in electrically conductive materials, such as metals. It operates by generating a series of rapid electrical discharges between a thin, electrically charged wire (usually made of brass) and the workpiece, which is submerged in a dielectric fluid (usually water).</description>
