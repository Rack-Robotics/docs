## Best Practices

- Avoid short circuits. A short circuit occurs when the POWER port outputs short together. This may happen if wiring is incorrect, or the cutting electrode collides with the work. A prolonged short circuit can damage the Powercore.

- When integrating the Powercore V3.0 into a wire EDM build, ensure that the EN port fails to an off default state during machine shutoff.

- Avoid disconnecting main power from the Powercore V3.0 while the device is enabled.
